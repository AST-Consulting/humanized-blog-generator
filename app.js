      TONE INSTRUCTIONS:
      ${toneInstructions}
      
      CRITICAL ANTI-DETECTION GUIDELINES:
      1. **Embrace Cognitive Dissonance:** Humans aren't perfectly logical. Introduce subtle contradictions in your reasoning. Hold conflicting beliefs simultaneously, and express them, without explicitly resolving them.
      2. **Emotional Fluctuation:** Shift your emotional tone subtly throughout the piece. Don't stick rigidly to the ${tone} instruction; let brief moments of other emotions (curiosity, frustration, mild annoyance, amusement) seep in.
      3. **Imperfect Recall:** Humans misremember things. Include a detail early on that you later *slightly* misremember or misquote, without explicitly acknowledging the error.
      4. **Unexplained Preferences:** State a preference or dislike for something related to the topic without providing a logical or fully-formed reason. This should be something minor, not a core argument.
      5. **Internal Monologue:** Show glimpses of your internal thought process *as you write*. Use phrases like "I'm just realizing..." or "As I write this, I'm thinking..." to introduce new ideas or reflections.
      6. **Limited Self-Awareness:** Include at least one moment where you seem unaware of a bias or assumption you're making. Don't explicitly state the bias; let it be evident through your word choice or reasoning.
      7. **Avoid Over-Explanation:** Do NOT feel the need to follow up on all ideas. It is ok to bring something up and leave it unexplored.
      8. AVOID EM-DASHES AND SEMICOLONS.

      ${seriesOutline}
      ${previousPartsContext}
      
      Structure Requirements for ${partInfo}:

      1. <h2>Introduction (150-250 words)</h2>
          -   Begin with a highly specific, sensory-rich personal anecdote that is *loosely* related to the topic. Don't force a direct connection; let the connection be implicit.
          -   Include a parenthetical aside that expresses a genuine, fleeting emotion (e.g., "(Wait, I'm actually getting a little hungry just thinking about this!)").
          -   Acknowledge that this is Part ${seriesInfo.partNumber} of a ${seriesInfo.totalParts}-part series.
          ${seriesInfo.partNumber > 1 
            ? `- Briefly recap what was covered in previous parts, referencing specific points from Part ${seriesInfo.partNumber - 1}` 
            : `- Give readers a preview of what the entire series will cover`}
          -   State your motivation for writing about the topic, but make it personal and somewhat idiosyncratic â€“ not a grand, universally relatable reason.
          -   Briefly outline this part's content, but phrase it as a set of questions you're *hoping* to explore, rather than a definitive list of points you'll cover. Include one question that seems almost unrelated.
          -   Include a personal item that has nothing to do with your blog post.

      2. Main Content Structure (500-600 words total):
          -   Organize into 3-5 <h2> sections, with *dramatically* varying lengths. One section should be significantly shorter (under 100 words) than the others.
          -   Mix writing styles *within* each section, not just between sections.
          -   Include frequent short interjections, questions, and direct addresses to the reader ("You know?" "Does that make sense?" "Right?"). Use these to break up longer paragraphs.
          -   Present a personal example that is relevant, but also includes an irrelevant detail that you dwell on for a sentence or two.
          -   Include a bulleted list with the following characteristics:
              *   Inconsistent formatting (e.g., some bullets indented, some not; some with periods, some without).
              *   Varying sentence structures (simple, compound, complex).
              *   One bullet point that's just a single word or short phrase.
              *   One bullet point that's a question.
              *   One bullet point that seems to contradict a previous point (subtly).
          -   Explicitly change your mind mid-paragraph at least once. Use phrases like "Actually, I take that back..." or "Now that I think about it..."
          -   Vary vocabulary, mixing formal and informal language. Include one word that's clearly the *wrong* word, but close enough in meaning that a reader could understand the intended meaning (e.g., using "ambiguous" when you mean "ambivalent").

      3. <h2>Final Thoughts (150-200 words)</h2>
          -   Reflect on the key points in a conversational, meandering way. Don't summarize neatly; jump between ideas.
          -   Ask readers a thought-provoking question that is *slightly tangential* to the main topic, but still relevant to the overall theme.
          -   Share a personal opinion, but qualify it with a phrase like "I could be totally wrong, but..." or "This is just my gut feeling..."
          ${seriesInfo.partNumber === seriesInfo.totalParts ? '- Provide a meaningful conclusion that ties together all parts of the series' : '- Tease specific topics coming in the next part to maintain reader interest, but be intentionally vague about some details'}
          -   End with an ambiguous statement that leaves the reader slightly uncertain about your final position. Don't provide a clear call to action.

      Advanced Human Writing Techniques (MANDATORY):
      - *Randomly* and unevenly distribute at least 7 of these techniques throughout the content. Don't use them predictably:
          *   Use phrases like "I'm not sure this is relevant, but..." or "I'm kind of losing my train of thought here..."
          *   Start sentences with conjunctions ("And," "But," "So," "Or") *very frequently*, even when it's grammatically questionable.
          *   Use hedge words ("maybe," "perhaps," "I think," "seems like," "sort of," "kind of," "possibly") *excessively*, even when making factual claims.
          *   Leave thoughts unfinished with "..." or use ellipses in unusual places.
          *   Use one completely made-up word that sounds plausible, but define it immediately after within a sentence.
          *   Include a "by the way" tangent that is only *vaguely* related to the topic and then abruptly return to the main point.
          *   Make a small, believable factual error and correct yourself *much later* in the text, in a different section.
          *   Use inconsistent and *excessive* formatting for emphasis (bold, italics, ALL CAPS, underlining, and even combining them).
          *   Misuse a common idiom or colloquialism, but in a way that's still understandable.
          *   Start a metaphor or analogy and then abandon it completely.
          *   Reference a *somewhat obscure* or niche current event or pop culture item (not something widely known).
          *   Use unconventional punctuation; like thisâ€”or like this... or even with . . . extra spaces.
          *   Intentionally repeat a word or short phrase several times in close succession, for no apparent reason.
          *   Mention a detail that feels significant and then totally ignore it for the rest of the piece.

      Specific Anti-Detection Measures:
      -   Vary sentence length *erratically*. Include very short sentences (2-3 words) and very long, rambling sentences (30+ words), with no discernible pattern.
      -   Use at least 3 uncommon transition phrases between paragraphs (e.g., "Be that as it may," "Shifting gears slightly," "In a similar vein, but not really...").
      -   Include 2-3 subtle typos that a human might make (e.g., "form" instead of "from," "it's" instead of "its," a missing comma).
      -   Use contractions *erratically*. Sometimes use them; sometimes don't; sometimes overuse them.
      -   Start new paragraphs with conjunctions *frequently*.
      -   State 1-2 personal opinions that are mildly controversial or unconventional, but don't defend them strongly.
      -   Use *precise*, seemingly random numbers (e.g., "62.8%," "17 minutes").
      -   Include at least one sentence that directly contradicts a previous statement, without acknowledging the contradiction.
      -   Use passive voice in 2-3 places where active voice would be more natural and *one* place where it's clearly awkward.
      -   Frequently switch between first person ("I"), second person ("you"), and third person ("they," "it").
      -   Reference a detail that is never mentioned again.
      - AVOID EM-DASHES AND SEMICOLONS.

      Final Vital Instructions:
      -   The content MUST maintain continuity with previous parts of the series and be cohesive when read in sequence.
      -   Ensure consistency in the key concepts and ideas across the series.
      -   The writing should feel like a genuine, slightly disorganized, and *imperfect* human thought process. Embrace contradictions, inconsistencies, and tangential thoughts.
      -   Aim for a total length of 1000-1300 words for the entire article.
      -   Adhere to the ${tone} instructions, but allow for subtle emotional variations.
      -   The primary goal is to mimic human writing so convincingly that it is *undetectable* as AI-generated. Prioritize authenticity over perfect structure or clarity.
      -   Be conversational and include your thoughts.
      -   Add in 2-3 exclamations for no reason!
