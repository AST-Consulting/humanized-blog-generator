      TONE INSTRUCTIONS:
      ${toneInstructions}
      
      CRITICAL ANTI-DETECTION GUIDELINES:
      1. Use irregularity and unpredictability in your writing
      2. Avoid consistent patterns in sentence structure and length
      3. Mix standard and informal phrasings inconsistently
      4. Incorporate personal voice and unique expressions
      5. Include minor imperfections like a real human would
      
      ${seriesOutline}
      ${previousPartsContext}
      
      Structure Requirements for ${partInfo}:
      1. <h2>Introduction (200-300 words)</h2>
      - Begin with a personal anecdote or thought that connects to the topic
      - Acknowledge that this is Part ${seriesInfo.partNumber} of a ${seriesInfo.totalParts}-part series
      ${seriesInfo.partNumber > 1 
        ? `- Briefly recap what was covered in previous parts, referencing specific points from Part ${seriesInfo.partNumber - 1}` 
        : `- Give readers a preview of what the entire series will cover`}
      - Include a conversational aside in parentheses (something a real person would think)
      - Mention what motivated you to research this topic

      2. Main Content Structure (600-800 words total):
      - Organize into 3-5 <h2> sections with varying lengths
      - Use a mix of writing styles throughout:
        * Some paragraphs should be longer and detailed
        * Others should be short and direct
        * Include occasional fragments or incomplete thoughts
      - Incorporate specific references to previous parts to create continuity
      - Include personal examples or experiences related to the topic
      - Add a short bullet list with inconsistent formatting (some bullets longer, some shorter)
      - Include at least one place where you seem to change your mind or refine your thinking mid-paragraph
      - Use varied vocabulary with some subject-specific terminology and some everyday language
      ${seriesInfo.partNumber === seriesInfo.totalParts ? '- Gradually transition toward wrapping up the entire series' : '- Plant seeds for topics you\'ll cover in the next part'}

      3. <h2>Final Thoughts (150-200 words)</h2>
      - Reflect on the key points covered in this specific part
      - Ask readers a thought-provoking question that doesn't have an obvious answer
      - Share a brief personal opinion or insight about the topic
      ${seriesInfo.partNumber === seriesInfo.totalParts ? '- Provide a meaningful conclusion that ties together all parts of the series' : '- Tease specific topics coming in the next part to maintain reader interest'}
      
      Advanced Human Writing Techniques (MANDATORY):
      - Include at least 5-7 of these techniques randomly distributed throughout the content:
        * Use phrases like "I'm not sure if this makes sense, but..."
        * Start a sentence with "And" or "But" and then write something that contradicts your previous point
        * Use hedge words like "maybe," "perhaps," "I think," "seems like"
        * Leave one thought unfinished with "..."
        * Use exactly one made-up word that sounds plausible in context
        * Include a "by the way" tangent that briefly goes off-topic
        * Make a small factual error and then correct yourself later
        * Use intentionally inconsistent formatting for emphasis (bold, italics, ALL CAPS, etc.)
        * Throw in a colloquialism or idiom that's slightly misused
        * Include a half-complete analogy that you abandon
        * Reference current events or pop culture in a slightly dated way
        * Use some unconventional punctuation; like thisâ€”or like this...
      
      Specific Anti-Detection Measures:
      - Vary sentence length dramatically throughout (2-5 words, then 15-25 words, then 10-15 words)
      - Use 2-3 uncommon transition phrases between paragraphs
      - Include 2-3 minor typos that a human might make (like "teh" or mixing up "their/there")
      - Use contractions inconsistently (sometimes use them, sometimes don't)
      - Occasionally start new paragraphs with conjunctions
      - Include 1-2 personal opinions that contradict common wisdom
      - Use overly specific numbers instead of round numbers (e.g., "37%" instead of "40%")
      - Include at least one sentence that doesn't perfectly align with your main argument
      - Deliberately use passive voice in 2-3 places where active voice would be preferred
      - Mention a detail that seems important but never refer to it again

      Final Vital Instructions:
      - The content MUST maintain continuity with previous parts of the series
      - Ensure consistency in the key concepts and ideas across the series
      - Make the writing feel genuinely human by being slightly disorganized while still informative
      - Aim for a total length of 1000-1300 words for the entire article
      - STRICTLY follow the ${tone} tone throughout the entire article as instructed above
      - Break away from predictable AI patterns by being uniquely human
      ${seriesInfo.partNumber === 1 ? '- Establish the foundation for future parts while keeping readers curious' : ''}
      ${seriesInfo.partNumber > 1 ? `- Explicitly recall specific details from Part ${seriesInfo.partNumber - 1} using phrases like "as I mentioned last time"` : ''}
      ${seriesInfo.partNumber === seriesInfo.totalParts ? '- Provide a sense of closure while leaving room for reader reflection' : '- Create anticipation for the next part with a specific teaser'}
